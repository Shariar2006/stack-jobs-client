                <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">What is an access token?</h1>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
                    An access token is a temporary, limited-use credential granted to a client application (e.g., a mobile app or a web application) after a user has successfully authenticated.
                    <br />
                    It is used to authorize the client application to access specific resources on behalf of the authenticated user.
                    <br />
                    Access tokens are typically short-lived, lasting for a relatively short duration, often measured in minutes or hours, to enhance security.
                    <br />
                    They are included in the HTTP headers of API requests made by the client to access protected resources, ensuring that the request is made on behalf of the authorized user.

            <div className="collapse-title ">
                <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">What is a refresh token?</h1>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
                    A refresh token is a long-lived credential that is used to obtain new access tokens without the user needing to reauthenticate.
                    <br />
                    Unlike access tokens, refresh tokens are typically long-lasting, often with a validity period measured in days or weeks.
                    <br />
                    They are securely stored on the client side (e.g., a mobile device or a web browser) and are used to request a new access token when the current access token expires.
                    <br />
                    The refresh token is a way to maintain a "long-term" authenticated session, eliminating the need for the user to provide their credentials (e.g., username and password) frequently.
                </p>

            <div className="collapse-title ">
                <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">How do  access token and refresh token work?</h1>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
                    A user logs in to an application or service, which uses an authentication provider to verify their identity.
                    <br />
                    Once the user is authenticated, the authentication provider issues an access token and a refresh token to the client application. The access token allows the client to access protected resources, and the refresh token allows the client to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to re-authenticate.
                    <br />
                    The client application uses the access token to make authorized requests to the resource server (e.g., an API).
                    <br />
                    Access tokens have a short lifespan to reduce the risk of unauthorized access if they are compromised. When an access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to request a new access token from the authentication provider.
                    <br />
                    If the refresh token is still valid, the authentication provider issues a new access token, and the client can continue to access resources on behalf of the user.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div className="collapse-title ">
                <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Where we should Store access token and refresh token on client-side?</h1>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
                    <span className="font-bold">Access Tokens:</span> These are typically stored on the client-side temporarily during an authenticated session. They should be stored securely, often in memory or within a secure storage mechanism provided by the platform or framework. It's important to ensure they are protected and not exposed to potential security risks.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
                    <span className="font-bold">Refresh Tokens:</span> These are stored on the client-side as well, but they are more sensitive and longer-lasting. Common storage methods include using HTTP-only cookies, secure server-side sessions, or secure storage mechanisms provided by the platform or framework. The goal is to protect refresh tokens from unauthorized access or exposure.

                    The choice of how and where to store these tokens may depend on your application's architecture and security requirements. It's essential to follow best practices for token storage and security to safeguard user data and resources.

                    <span className="font-bold">Middleware:</span> Express uses middleware functions that can be added to the request/response pipeline. Middleware functions can perform tasks such as logging, authentication, parsing request data, and error handling. You can use built-in middleware or create custom middleware to suit your application's needs.
                </p>

                    Express.js is open-source and has a large and active community, which has led to the development of many third-party libraries and extensions to enhance its functionality. This ecosystem makes Express a versatile choice for building a wide range of web applications and APIs in Node.js. It's worth noting that while Express can be used for both small and large-scale projects, it is particularly well-suited for lightweight and fast development.
